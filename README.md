# CustomerChurnPrediction
# Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, businesses can identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to retain them. The model uses various features such as demographics, subscription details, usage patterns, and customer interactions to predict churn probability.
# Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Comparison of multiple classification models
- Performance metrics analysis (Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix, etc.)
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of churn patterns
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Deployment-ready scripts
# Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- XGBoost, LightGBM
- Flask (for deployment)
# Dataset
The dataset consists of customer-related attributes such as:
- Customer ID
- Demographics (Age, Gender, etc.)
- Subscription Details (Plan, Tenure, Contract Type)
- Usage Patterns (Monthly Charges, Total Charges)
- Customer Support Interactions**
- Churn Label (1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)
- # Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd Customer_Churn_Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   # Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Balancing the dataset using techniques like SMOTE (if needed)
# Model Training & Evaluation
The project implements various machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- Neural Networks (optional enhancement)
# Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score: Measures overall correctness
- AUC-ROC Score: Evaluates classification performance
- Confusion Matrix: Visualizes true positives, false positives, etc.
- Precision, Recall, F1-score: Assess model robustness
- Cross-validation: Ensures generalization of the model
# Results & Analysis
- Comparison of different models' performance
- Feature importance analysis to determine key factors influencing churn
- Visualization of churn patterns through graphs and heatmaps
- Interpretation of model predictions using SHAP values
# Model Deployment
To make the model accessible, it can be deployed using Flask or FastAPI:
1. Convert the trained model to a pickle (`.pkl`) file.
2. Create a simple Flask API to expose the model.
3. Deploy the API on a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
# Future Enhancements
- Advanced hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI with a frontend dashboard
- Implementing deep learning techniques (ANNs, LSTMs)
- Integrating real-time data pipelines for dynamic prediction
- Building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
# Conclusion
This project provides insights into customer churn prediction using machine learning. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates effectively. The inclusion of feature importance analysis and model interpretability helps decision-makers understand why customers are churning.
